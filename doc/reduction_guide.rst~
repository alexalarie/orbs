A 2 steps reduction
===================

Each reduction can be divided in two major steps :

* :ref:`creation-option-file`
* :ref:`start-reduction-process`


.. _creation-option-file:

Creation of the option file
===========================

Many parameters must be passed to ORBS for a reduction. An option file
is just a list of these parameters recorded into a text file, each
line being made of a keyword and its value, e.g.::

  OBJECT M1-67 # Object name
  FILTER SPIOMM_R # Filter
  SPESTEP 3852 # Step size in nm
  SPESTNB 415 # Step nb
  SPEORDR 11 # Aliasing order
  SPEEXPT 30 # Integration time
  DIRCAM1 /data/spiomm/M1-67/cam1/ # Path to the raw images of the camera 1
  DIRCAM2 /data/spiomm/M1-67/cam2/ # Path to the raw images of the camera 2
  DIRCAL1 /data/spiomm/M1-67/HeNe/ # Calibration laser images of camera 1

Some of the parameters in this file must be present while some are
just optional.

Required parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters are required if you want to transform you raw
interferometric images into a spectral cube:

* **OBJECT**: The name of the object. It is only used to name the
  output files and can be anything (as long as it does not contain any
  white space).
* **FILTER**: Must be a valid name. The list of the available filters
  can be found in ORB data folder (:file:`orb/data/filter_*`). For SITELLE's
  data you can refer to the keyword FILTER in the header of the data
  files.
* **SPESTEP**: Step size in nm. At this point it is not directly given
  in the header of SITELLE's data and must be calculated (see
  :ref:`compute-step-size`).
* **SPESTNB**: Number of steps expected in the scan (i.e. number of
  raw files acquired if the scan has been completed). It must be at
  least equal to the number of raw images.
* **SPEORDR**: Aliasing (or folding) order (you can refer to SITORDER
  in SITELLE's files header).
* **DIRCAM1**: Absolute path to the raw images of the camera 1
* **DIRCAM2**: Absolute path to the raw images of the camera 2 (For
  SITELLE both paths must be the same)
* **SPEEXPT**: Integration time of each frame (in s)
* **DIRCAL1**: Path to the folder containing the calibration laser
  images of the camera 1.

.. note:: When a path to a folder is expected, the folder must only
          contain the requested files (i.e. the folder set to DIRCAL1
          must only contain the images of the calibration lase
          cube). If all you files are in the same folder you can give
          the path to a file list (see :ref:`file-list`).


.. _compute-step-size:

How to compute the step size in nm from SITELLE'S data files header ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following formula can be used: 

.. math:: \frac{(n + 1) \times \lambda_{\text{min}}}{2}

:math:`n` : Aliasing order (SITORDER)

:math:`\lambda_{\text{min}}` : Minimum wavelength of the filter (SITLAMIN)

Optional parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters are considered as optional because you can
get a spectral cube without them. But they might prove useful if you
want to correct your images for the bias, dark current and flat field
and calibrate your files in energy, angle and wavelength.

Bias, dark and flat field correction
------------------------------------

* **DIRBIA1**: Path to a folder containing the bias frames of the camera 1.
* **DIRBIA2**: Path to a folder containing the bias frames of the camera 2.
* **DIRDRK1**: Path to a folder containing the dark frames of the camera 1.
* **DIRDRK2**: Path to a folder containing the dark frames of the camera 2.
* **DIRFLT1**: Path to a folder containing the flat frames of the camera 1.
* **DIRFLT2**: Path to a folder containing the flat frames of the camera 2.

  DIRBIA1 /home/thomas/Réduction/Données/Data_2012_06/BIAS/cam1
  DIRBIA2 /home/thomas/Réduction/Données/Data_2012_06/BIAS/cam2/4x4
  DIRDRK1 /home/thomas/Réduction/Données/Data_2012_06/DARK/cam1
  DIRDRK2 /home/thomas/Réduction/Données/Data_2012_06/DARK/cam2/4x4
  DIRFLT1 /home/thomas/Réduction/Données/Data_2012_06/FLAT/R/cam1/3x3
  DIRFLT2 /home/thomas/Réduction/Données/Data_2012_06/FLAT/R/cam2/4x4

.. warning:: **SITELLE**: Bias correction is automatically done from
             the overscan part of the data: do not give a path to bias
             frames because it will result in subtracting two times
             the bias.


.. warning:: **SpIOMM**: In the recent observations, a bias frame is
             taken at each exposition with the camera 2. In this case
             the bias is automatically subtracted. Only the path to
             the bias files for the camera 1 is thus required. Giving
             a path for the bias frames of the camera 2 would result
             in subtracting two times the bias.


Calibration data
----------------

* **CALIBMAP**: Path to a calibration laser map. The way you can
  obtain this map is described at the section
  :ref:`reduce-calibration`. If the same calibration laser cube is
  used for multiple science cubes it is faster to compute the
  calibration map once and for all instead.

* **STDPATH**: Path to the spectrum of a standard star. The spectrum
  must have been reduced by ORBS following the procedure described at
  the section :ref:`standard-star`. **STDNAME** must also be set.

* **STDNAME**: Name of the standard star. A list of the available
  standard name can be found in ORB data folder:
  :file:`orb/data/std_table.orb`::

    STDNAME HD74721
    STDPATH /data/calib/HD74721/HD74721_SPIOMM_R.merged.standard_spectrum.fits

* **TARGETX**, **TARGETY**, **TARGETR**, **TARGETD**: Image position
  along X and Y axis and celestial coordinates (RA, DEC) of a point
  near the center of the image. The astrometrical calibration will be
  computed from a star catalog query (USNO-B1) around this point (An
  internet connection must be available)::

    TARGETR 19:11:30.857
    TARGETD +16:51:39.92
    TARGETX 214.31944
    TARGETY 205.87269


.. seealso:: All the other possible parameters are described in
   :py:class:`orbs.orbs.Orbs`.


.. _start-reduction-process:

Start of the reduction process
==============================

Start command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reduction process can be started with the command (see
:ref:`how-can-access-orbs-commands`)::

  orbs options.opt start

At the end of the process the reduced cube is written in the root
folder where you have launched the command,
e.g. :file:`M1-67_SPIOMM_R.merged.nm.1.0.fits`. Its exact name can
change depending on the kind of chosen output (see
:ref:`choosing-right-output`).



.. note:: It is recommended that you create a new folder where you can
   put your option file (e.g. :file:`options.opt`) and start the
   reduction process.


Choosing your starting step
---------------------------

Sometimes it can be useful to restart a reduction from a particular
step in order to change the reduction output type (or because of an
error, but in this case, the *resume* operation is generally better
see :ref:`other-operations`). This can be achieved with the option
:option:`--step` followed by the step number, e.g.::

  orbs options.opt start --step 11

The step number changes with the desired target (see
:ref:`reduce-calibration`). But for the default target (an
astrophysical object) the :ref:`road-map` is:

0. Compute alignment vector (camera 1).

1. Compute alignment vector (camera 2).

2. Compute cosmic ray map (camera 1)
3. Compute cosmic ray map (camera 2)
4. Compute interferogram (camera 1)
5. Compute interferogram (camera 2)
6. Transform cube B 
7. Merge interferograms 
8. Compute calibration laser map (camera 1)
9. Compute phase 
10. Compute phase maps 
11. Compute spectrum 
12. Calibrate spectrum 



  



.. _other-operations:

Other operations with orbs command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Other operations are possible with the orbs command:

:option:`resume`: Resume the last reduction process launched. If all
the steps have been done, the output file is written again on the root
folder::
          
  orbs options.opt resume

:option:`clean`: Clean the directory from the files created during the
reduction::
          
  orbs options.opt clean

:option:`status`: Display the status (:ref:`road-map` and step status)
of all the launched reduction processes::
          
  orbs options.opt status


.. note:: All the operations are attached to the option file of the
          command line.


Reduction files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of reduction files are created during the process. The most
important are described here.

Temporary reduction folder
--------------------------

First of all a temporary reduction folder is created. It is named
after the object name and the filter used
(e.g. :file:`M1-67_SPIOMM_R/`). This way different data cubes of the
same object taken with different filters can be reduced in the same
folder.

Log file
--------

A log file named after the option file (e.g. :file:`options.opt.log`)
is created. It contains all the comments, warnings and error messages
that are displayed on the screen.





.. _reduce-calibration:

Reduce your calibration files
=============================

Laser cube (wavelength/wavenumber calibration)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. _standard-star:

Standard star (photometrical calibration)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Continuum source cube (Phase map)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _choosing-right-output:

Choosing the right output
=========================

Wavelength or wavenumber ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To apodize or not to apodize ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why you might not want the spectral calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core concepts
=============

.. _file-list:

File list
~~~~~~~~~

A file list is a text file containing absolute paths, one line by
file (e.g.)::

  /path/to/file/1.fits
  /path/to/file/2.fits
  /path/to/file/3.fits
  /path/to/file/4.fits
  
It can be created automatically on a UNIX-like system with the
command::

  ls /path/to/file/*.fits >files_list


.. _road-map:

Road Map
~~~~~~~~

A road map defines a reduction sequence as a list of reduction
steps. A different roadmap is defined for each target (object,
standard star, laser cube, flat cube etc.) and each instrument has its
own set of roadmaps. Note also that some target have different
roadmaps depending on the camera we want to reduce.

All the roadmaps are stored in ORBS data folder
(:file:`orbs/data/roadmap.*`). The name of a roadmap file is defined
as follows::

  roadmap.[instrument].[target].[camera].xml

- *instrument* can be *spiomm* or *sitelle*
- *target* can be one of the special targets listed above or object
  for the default target
- *camera* can be *full* for a process using both cameras; *single1*
  or *single2* for a process using only the camera 1 or 2.

e.g. the roadmap file for the default reduction process of SITELLE is
:file:`orbs/data/roadmap.sitelle.object.full.xml`

.. seealso:: More on roadmaps and their syntax is given in
             :py:class:`orbs.orbs.RoadMap`
