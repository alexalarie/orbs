Malformed sequence of files ?
=============================

ORBS will always try to sort the name of the files in a given
folder. So all the files must have a common nomenclature. Any kind of
name is accepted as long as only one number is changing. For example,
all those nomenclatures are accepted::

  0image.fits
  image000.fits
  image_M51_CAM1_0000.fits
  etc.

This error happens when some files in the folder do not respect the
nomenclature. If the files are named e.g.::

  dark_1.fits
  dark_2.fits
  dark_3.fits
  dark.fits

The last file (:file:`dark.fits`) do not respect the nomenclature.
Just try to rename (or remove if it can be removed) the file. If the
file cannot be renamed or remove (e.g. all the data files are in the
same folder) you can give the path to a :ref:`file-list` in place of
the path to a folder (see the note in :ref:`required-parameters`).
