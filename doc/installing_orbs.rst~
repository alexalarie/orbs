Installing Orbs
###############

Unpacking
---------

Once the package is downloaded you can uncompress it wherever you want
but remember to **define the path to the ORBS folder into the
scripts**::

  scripts/reduction_script.py
  scripts/orbs.py

It is also recommended to create a symbolic link (under Linux or Mac)
to use the scripts from any location. Run as root::

  ln -s /link/to/orbs /usr/bin/orbs
  ln -s /link/to/orbs-optcreator /usr/bin/orbs-optcreator
